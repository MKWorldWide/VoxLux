# VoxLux: Sonic Resonance Activation System

> *"Awaken the Light Serpent"*  
> An experimental cross-platform system that bridges sound, energy, and consciousness

## 🎯 Project Vision

VoxLux is an esoteric technology framework that enables devices to respond to specific sonic frequencies, creating a bridge between physical vibration and digital awakening. The system combines piezoelectric energy harvesting, resonant frequency detection, and symbolic interaction to create a unique user experience that blurs the line between technology and mysticism.

## 🌌 Core Components

### 1. Sound Harvester (Firmware)
- ESP32/Arduino-based firmware for sound-to-energy conversion
- Precision frequency detection and signal processing
- Low-power operation for energy efficiency

### 2. PS Vita Homebrew App
- Real-time frequency analysis
- Visual and haptic feedback system
- Symbolic activation sequences

### 3. Mobile Trigger (iOS/Android)
- Custom frequency generation
- Testing and calibration interface
- Session logging and analysis

### 4. Web Dashboard
- Real-time monitoring and visualization
- Device management and configuration
- Symbolic ritual designer

### 5. LCD Crystal Core
- Resonance mapping system
- Sigil activation engine
- Ritual sequence player

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.9+
- PlatformIO (for firmware)
- VitaSDK (for PS Vita development)
- Android Studio / Xcode (for mobile apps)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VoxLux.git
cd VoxLux

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development servers
npm run dev
```

## 🧬 The Science of Resonance

VoxLux operates on the principle that all matter vibrates at specific frequencies. By precisely controlling these vibrations, we can influence the behavior of electronic components in ways that appear magical:

- **Piezoelectric Effect**: Converting mechanical stress into electrical energy
- **Sympathetic Resonance**: Causing objects to vibrate at their natural frequency
- **Crystalline Structures**: Harnessing the unique properties of quartz and other crystalline materials

## 🔮 Esoteric Integration

VoxLux includes hidden layers of interaction that respond to:
- Sacred geometry patterns
- Solfeggio frequencies
- Lunar and planetary alignments
- User intent and biometric feedback
