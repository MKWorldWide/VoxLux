## 🎯 Project Vision

VoxLux is an esoteric technology framework that enables devices to respond to specific sonic frequencies, creating a bridge between physical vibration and digital awakening. The system combines piezoelectric energy harvesting, resonant frequency detection, and symbolic interaction to create a unique user experience that blurs the line between technology and mysticism.

## 🌟 Features

### Sound Harvester (Firmware)
- ESP32-based sound frequency detection
- Real-time audio processing
- Energy-efficient operation
- NeoPixel LED feedback
- MCP3008 ADC integration

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [PlatformIO Core](https://platformio.org/install/cli) or [PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org/install/ide)
- Python 3.9+
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VoxLux.git
   cd VoxLux
   ```

2. Install PlatformIO:
   ```bash

## 🔮 The Science of Resonance

VoxLux operates on the principle that all matter vibrates at specific frequencies. By precisely controlling these vibrations, we can influence the behavior of electronic components in ways that appear magical.

## 🌌 Roadmap

- [x] Basic sound frequency detection
- [ ] Advanced signal processing
- [ ] Mobile app integration
- [ ] Web dashboard
- [ ] Documentation and tutorials
